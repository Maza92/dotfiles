## Description

This repository contains my modifications to the dynamic dotfiles from [linkfrg/dotfiles](https://github.com/linkfrg/dotfiles), which use [Ignis](https://github.com/linkfrg/ignis) to generate color palettes based on the wallpaper. Here, I share my additions and adjustments as an extension of the original project.
